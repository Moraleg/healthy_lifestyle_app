Approach Taken

Two-model CRUD application for scheduling and keeping track of workout routines. Users can create an account, login, keep track of workout routines by creating events via calendar.

Unsolved Problems

Data refreshes after logout

Notes/Planned Features

Would like to add the functionality for users to update and delete the events they created. I would also like to incorporate a progress section, which will track the exercise progress of the user for a given week.
